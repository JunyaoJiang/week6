We picked the GNU GPL as it also used by Linux, WordPress and many other openly sourced softwares. Quoting directly from its [website](https://www.gnu.org/home.html) , GNU, "respects users' freedom". We love respecting people's freedoms so we chose it.
We chose the Contributer Covenant because it welcomes all people to share and "fosters a atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and understanding".
